postgresql-8.4 (8.4~0cvs20090328-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Package current trunk, which will become 8.4 in time. Packaging branched
    from 8.3 packaging trunk. Move from cdbs' tarball.mk to bzr-builddeb.
  * Drop obsolete patches:
    - 03-gettext-domains.patch: Adopted upstream.
    - 04-psql-passwordprompt.patch: Obsoleted by new psql -w option.
    - 05-check-rlimits-nofile.patch: Adopted upstream.
  * Update remaining patches for new upstream version.
  * Add debian/docbook2man-sgmlspl/docbook2man-spec{.pl,_makelinks}: Current
    Debian version in docbook-utils is way too old and broken (see #275715,
    #271611), locally ship the current ones from upstream, in order to build
    manpages.
  * debian/rules: Build documentation and manpage tarballs if not present (as
    with building from CVS). Add necessary build dependencies docbook-utils,
    openjade, and docbook.
