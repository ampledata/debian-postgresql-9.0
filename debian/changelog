postgresql-8.4 (8.4~0cvs20090328-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Package current trunk, which will become 8.4 in time. Packaging branched
    from 8.3 packaging trunk. Move from cdbs' tarball.mk to bzr-builddeb.
  * Drop debian/patches/03-gettext-domains.patch: Upstream now uses major
    version specific gettext domains.
