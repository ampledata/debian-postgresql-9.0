  [ Alexander Sack ]
  * Add 04-armel-tas.patch: Fix ftbfs on armel: Use gcc intrinsics rather
    than assembler to implement tas (test and set). (LP: #497331)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Drop 15-dict-fallback-dir.patch: p-common 104 now directly creates the
    names tsearch is looking for. Bump p-common dependency accordingly.

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Medium urgency due to security fixes.

  [ Peter Eisentraut ]
  * debian/control: Added Homepage
  * debian/control: Added ${misc:Depends} on all packages, per lintian
  * debian/control: Added versioned dependencies on the shared libraries used 
    by the libecpg-dev package
  * debian/control: Removed obsolete build dependency bzip2
  * debian/control: Added Vcs fields

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Protect against indirect security threats caused by index functions
      changing session-local state. This change prevents allegedly-immutable
      index functions from possibly subverting a superuser's session
      (CVE-2009-4136).
    - Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte in the
      common name (CN) field. This prevents unintended matching of a
      certificate to a server or client name during SSL validation
      (CVE-2009-4034).
    - Fix hash index corruption. The 8.4 change that made hash indexes keep
      entries sorted by hash value failed to update the bucket splitting and
      compaction routines to preserve the ordering. So application of either
      of those operations could lead to permanent corruption of an index, in
      the sense that searches might fail to find entries that are present. To
      deal with this, it is recommended to REINDEX any hash indexes you may
      have after installing this update.
    - Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache initialization.
    - Avoid crash on empty thesaurus dictionary.
    - Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times.
    - Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
      calculation.
    - Fix crash if a DROP is attempted on an internally-dependent object.
    - Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons.
    - Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared transactions
      are not ignored.
    - Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor that is
      accessed within a subtransaction.
    - Fix memory leak in syslogger process when rotating to a new CSV
      logfile.
    - Fix memory leak in postmaster when re-parsing "pg_hba.conf".
    - Make FOR UPDATE/SHARE in the primary query not propagate into WITH
      queries.
    - Fix bug with a WITH RECURSIVE query immediately inside another one.
    - Fix concurrency bug in hash indexes.
    - Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the split
      depends on a non-first column of the index.
    - Fix wrong search results for a multi-column GIN index with
      fastupdate enabled.
    - Fix bugs in WAL entry creation for GIN indexes.
    - Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file fails at
      the end of checkpoint.
    - Fix PAM password processing to be more robust.
      The previous code is known to fail with the combination of the
      Linux pam_krb5 PAM module with Microsoft Active Directory as the
      domain controller. It might have problems elsewhere too, since it
      was making unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM
      stack would pass to it.
    - Raise the maximum authentication token (Kerberos ticket) size in
      GSSAPI and SSPI authentication methods. While the old 2000-byte limit
      was more than enough for Unix Kerberos implementations, tickets issued
      by Windows Domain Controllers can be much larger.
    - Ensure that domain constraints are enforced in constructs like
      ARRAY[...]::domain, where the domain is over an array type.
    - Fix foreign-key logic for some cases involving composite-type
      columns as foreign keys.
    - Ensure that a cursor's snapshot is not modified after it is created.
    - Fix CREATE TABLE to properly merge default expressions coming from
      different inheritance parent tables. This used to work but was broken in
      8.4.
    - Re-enable collection of access statistics for sequences. This used to
      work but was broken in 8.3.
    - Fix processing of ownership dependencies during CREATE OR REPLACE
      FUNCTION.
    - Fix incorrect handling of WHERE "x"="x" conditions.
      In some cases these could get ignored as redundant, but they aren't
      -- they're equivalent to "x" IS NOT NULL.
    - Fix incorrect plan construction when using hash aggregation to
      implement DISTINCT for textually identical volatile expressions
    - Fix Assert failure for a volatile SELECT DISTINCT ON expression
    - Fix ts_stat() to not fail on an empty tsvector value
    - Make text search parser accept underscores in XML attributes
    - Fix encoding handling in xml binary input.
      If the XML header doesn't specify an encoding, we now assume UTF-8
      by default; the previous handling was inconsistent.
    - Fix bug with calling plperl from plperlu or vice versa.
    - Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function is
      redefined.
    - Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to PostgreSQL arrays
      when returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function.
    - Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python.
    - Fix ecpg problem with comments in DECLARE CURSOR statements
    - Fix ecpg to not treat recently-added keywords as reserved words
      This affected the keywords CALLED, CATALOG, DEFINER, ENUM,
      FOLLOWING, INVOKER, OPTIONS, PARTITION, PRECEDING, RANGE, SECURITY,
      SERVER, UNBOUNDED, and WRAPPER.
    - Re-allow regular expression special characters in psql's \df
      function name parameter.
    - Put FREEZE and VERBOSE options in the right order in the VACUUM
      command that "contrib/vacuumdb" produces.
    - Fix possible leak of connections when "contrib/dblink" encounters
      an error
    - Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
      connection request packets, to improve compatibility with future
      libpq versions.
  * debian/control: libreadline5-dev â†’ libreadline-dev. (Closes: #553831)
  * Add 03-sh-architecture.patch: Support Renesas' SuperH architecture, thanks
    Nobuhiro Iwamatsu! (Closes: #548847)

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium due to security fix.
  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Disallow "RESET ROLE" and "RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
      security-definer functions. This covers a case that was missed in the
      previous patch that disallowed "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION" inside security-definer functions. [CVE-2007-6600]
    - Fix WAL page header initialization at the end of archive recovery.
      This could lead to failure to process the WAL in a subsequent archive
      recovery.
    - Fix "cannot make new WAL entries during recovery" error.
    - Fix problem that could make expired rows visible after a crash.
      This bug involved a page status bit potentially not being set
      correctly after a server crash.
    - Make "LOAD" of an already-loaded loadable module into a no-op.
      Formerly, "LOAD" would attempt to unload and re-load the module,
      but this is unsafe and not all that useful.
    - Make window function PARTITION BY and ORDER BY items always be
      interpreted as simple expressions.
      In 8.4.0 these lists were parsed following the rules used for
      top-level GROUP BY and ORDER BY lists. But this was not correct per
      the SQL standard, and it led to possible circularity.
    - Fix several errors in planning of semi-joins. These led to wrong query
      results in some cases where IN or EXISTS was used together with another
      join.
    - Fix handling of whole-row references to subqueries that are within
      an outer join. An example is SELECT COUNT(ss.-) FROM ... LEFT JOIN
      (SELECT ...) ss ON .... Here, ss.- would be treated as
      ROW(NULL,NULL,...) for null-extended join rows, which is not the same as
      a simple NULL.  Now it is treated as a simple NULL.
    - Fix locale handling with plperl. This bug could cause the server's
      locale setting to change when a plperl function is called, leading to
      data corruption.
    - Fix handling of reloptions to ensure setting one option doesn't
      force default values for others.
    - Ensure that a "fast shutdown" request will forcibly terminate open
      sessions, even if a "smart shutdown" was already in progress.
    - Avoid memory leak for array_agg() in GROUP BY queries.
    - Treat to_char(..., 'TH') as an uppercase ordinal suffix with
      'HH'/'HH12'.  It was previously handled as 'th'.
    - Include the fractional part in the result of EXTRACT(second) and
      EXTRACT(milliseconds) for time and time with time zone inputs.
      This has always worked for floating-point datetime configurations,
      but was broken in the integer datetime code.
    - Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when "x" is more than 2 million
      and integer datetimes are in use.
    - Improve performance when processing toasted values in index scans.
      This is particularly useful for PostGIS.
    - Fix a typo that disabled commit_delay.
    - Output early-startup messages to "postmaster.log" if the server is
      started in silent mode. Previously such error messages were discarded,
      leading to difficulty in debugging.
    - Remove translated FAQs. They are now on the wiki. The main FAQ was moved
      to the wiki some time ago.
    - Fix pg_ctl to not go into an infinite loop if "postgresql.conf" is
      empty.
    - Fix several errors in pg_dump's --binary-upgrade mode. pg_dump
      --binary-upgrade is used by pg_migrator.
    - Fix "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process() to properly handle the maximum
      number of parameters (twenty).
    - Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors during
      "COPY FROM STDIN".
    - Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header files when
      both libraries are installed.
    - Work around gcc bug that causes "floating-point exception" instead
      of "division by zero" on some platforms.
